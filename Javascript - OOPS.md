# What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into **objects** containing:

- Data (Properties)
- Behavior (Methods)

### Four Pillars

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

---

# Object Literal

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "Vipul",

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`);
  }
};

user.greet();
```

Used for small objects.

---

# Constructor Function (Old Way)

```javascript
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

User.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log(this.name);
};

const u1 = new User("Vipul");
```

Before ES6 classes.

---

# ES6 Class

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

const user = new User("Vipul");
```

Remember:

Classes are **syntactic sugar** over prototypes.

---

# this Keyword

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(name){
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet(){
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}
```

`this` refers to the object calling the method.

Example:

```javascript
user.greet();
```

Inside greet()

```
this === user
```

---

# Encapsulation

Keeping data and methods together.

```javascript
class BankAccount {

  balance = 0;

  deposit(amount){
      this.balance += amount;
  }

  getBalance(){
      return this.balance;
  }
}
```

---

# Private Fields (Real Encapsulation)

```javascript
class BankAccount {

   #balance = 0;

   deposit(amount){
      this.#balance += amount;
   }

   getBalance(){
      return this.#balance;
   }
}
```

Cannot access

```javascript
account.#balance
```

Interview Point

Private fields start with **#**

---

# Abstraction

Hide implementation details.

```javascript
class Payment {

   pay(){
      this.validate();
      this.process();
   }

   validate(){}

   process(){}
}
```

User only calls

```javascript
payment.pay();
```

No need to know internal logic.

---

# Inheritance

Child class inherits parent.

```javascript
class Animal {

   speak(){
      console.log("Animal speaks");
   }
}

class Dog extends Animal {

   bark(){
      console.log("Bark");
   }
}

const dog = new Dog();

dog.speak();
dog.bark();
```

---

# super()

Calls parent constructor or method.

```javascript
class Animal{

   constructor(name){
      this.name = name;
   }
}

class Dog extends Animal{

   constructor(name){
      super(name);
   }
}
```

Without `super()`

```
ReferenceError
```

---

# Polymorphism

Same method behaves differently.

```javascript
class Animal{

   speak(){
      console.log("...");
   }
}

class Dog extends Animal{

   speak(){
      console.log("Bark");
   }
}

class Cat extends Animal{

   speak(){
      console.log("Meow");
   }
}
```

```
dog.speak();

cat.speak();
```

Different outputs.

---

# Method Overriding

```javascript
class Parent{

   greet(){
      console.log("Hello");
   }
}

class Child extends Parent{

   greet(){
      console.log("Hi");
   }
}
```

Child replaces parent implementation.

---

# Static Methods

Belong to class.

Not object.

```javascript
class MathUtil{

   static add(a,b){
      return a+b;
   }
}

MathUtil.add(2,3);
```

Cannot do

```javascript
const m = new MathUtil();

m.add();
```

---

# Getter & Setter

```javascript
class User{

   constructor(name){
      this._name = name;
   }

   get name(){
      return this._name;
   }

   set name(value){
      this._name = value;
   }
}
```

Usage

```javascript
user.name = "John";

console.log(user.name);
```

---

# Prototype

Every JS object has a prototype.

```
Object

↓

Prototype

↓

null
```

Example

```javascript
function User(){}

User.prototype.sayHi = function(){
    console.log("Hi");
};

const u = new User();

u.sayHi();
```

---

# Prototype Chain

```
Dog

↓

Animal

↓

Object

↓

null
```

JavaScript searches upward until it finds the property.

---

# Class vs Constructor Function

| Constructor Function | ES6 Class |
|----------------------|----------|
| Older syntax | Modern syntax |
| Uses prototype manually | Uses class keyword |
| More verbose | Cleaner |
| Same prototype mechanism | Same prototype mechanism |

---

# Object.create()

Creates object with custom prototype.

```javascript
const animal = {
   speak(){
      console.log("...");
   }
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);

dog.speak();
```

---

# instanceof

Checks inheritance.

```javascript
dog instanceof Dog

dog instanceof Animal

dog instanceof Object
```

Returns true if prototype exists in chain.

---

# hasOwnProperty()

Checks own property only.

```javascript
user.hasOwnProperty("name");
```

Doesn't check prototype.

---

# Object.keys()

Own enumerable keys.

```javascript
Object.keys(user);
```

---

# Object.values()

```javascript
Object.values(user);
```

---

# Object.entries()

```javascript
Object.entries(user);
```

---

# Object.freeze()

Cannot modify.

```javascript
const user = Object.freeze({
   name:"Vipul"
});
```

---

# Object.seal()

Can update existing.

Cannot add/remove.

---

# Composition vs Inheritance

Inheritance

```
Dog extends Animal
```

Composition

```
Car has Engine
```

Modern JavaScript prefers **Composition over Inheritance** because it is more flexible and avoids tight coupling.

# Interview Questions

## Why were ES6 classes introduced?

Cleaner syntax over prototypes.

---

## Are classes real classes?

No.

They are syntactic sugar over prototypes.

---

## Difference between class and prototype?

Class is syntax.

Prototype is the actual inheritance mechanism.

---

## Difference between Object.create() and new?

new

- Calls constructor
- Sets prototype
- Returns object

Object.create()

- Doesn't call constructor
- Only links prototype

---

## Why use private fields?

To prevent direct access and achieve encapsulation.

---

## Difference between static and instance methods?

Instance

```javascript
user.greet();
```

Static

```javascript
User.create();
```

---

## What is method overriding?

Child replaces parent implementation.

---

## Does JavaScript support multiple inheritance?

No.

Can use

- Mixins
- Composition

---

## Why is composition preferred?

- Loose coupling
- Easier testing
- Better scalability
- More reusable

# Common Interview One-Liners

✔ JavaScript is prototype-based, not class-based.

✔ ES6 classes are syntactic sugar over prototypes.

✔ Every object has an internal [[Prototype]].

✔ Inheritance works via prototype chain.

✔ `new` creates object + links prototype + executes constructor.

✔ `this` depends on how a function is called.

✔ Prefer Composition over Inheritance.

✔ Use private fields (#) for encapsulation.

✔ Static methods belong to class, not instances.

✔ Prototype methods are shared across all instances.

# 30-Second Summary

- Object → Collection of properties & methods
- Class → Blueprint
- Object → Instance of class
- Encapsulation → Hide data
- Abstraction → Hide implementation
- Inheritance → Reuse code
- Polymorphism → Same method, different behavior
- Prototype → Real inheritance mechanism
- ES6 Class → Cleaner syntax over prototype
- Composition > Inheritance (preferred)
